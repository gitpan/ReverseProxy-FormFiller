ReverseProxy-FormFiller

ReverseProxy::FormFiller makes an Apache server, positioned as a
frontal server or as a reverse-proxy, fill and (possibly) submit html
forms in place of users.

This is particularly intended for authentication forms, if you want
users to be authenticated with some account, but if you don't want them
to know and type any password. But it also works with any html form.
